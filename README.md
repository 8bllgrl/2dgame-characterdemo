# 2dgame-characterdemo
Java Swing. Experimental Java based 2D Game to operate a character. 

This is a personal project, hopefully leading up to a larger one, where I make a somewhat functioning game dealing with these characters. :)
The plan of this current project, the character creator demo, is practice the use of sprite sheets to create character animations, using JPanel and JFrame to create visuals, an FPS counter and working game loop, and setting different variables to a character, such as being able to change the character's age, apperance, gender, animation, and voice.
